free.  ok.  not everything on website worked.

jQuery Mobile --> straight up with ThemeRoller tool to make interfaces faster.  Use with PhoneGap!  Not sure if the result is an app or just website.

Appcelerator
------------
TURNS OUT TO BE DIFFICULT TO USE.
Appcelerator Titanium --> builds cross platform apps that become native apps on iOS, Android, and Blackberry, Windows
Appcelerator Studio --> wanted to download Android SDK 5.0.1.  But we can choose 6 instead.
