dyno - 'deployment environment' - a heroku container, similar to a docker container


  * Heroku makes a git remote called 'heroku' which you can push to every time you want to update the code for an app.

  * runtime.txt may allow us to specify python version

Procfile - A "process file" which defines which processes need to be run for your app.  Typically, there is a single process of type "web" which kicks off your webserver/webframework.

.env - Use "heroku config vars" through the GUI to set environment variables that get used on heroku itself.  But use ".env" file to set environment variables that get used locally (heroku local).
